    <h1>About Agony</h1>
  </header>

  <section>
    <h2>History</h2>

<p>At the beginning of 2006, Agony was founded by a small group of players
who wanted to teach new players the basics of PVP.
Since that time, Agony has gone from a ten character corporation that only flew frigates,
to a 250 character corporation that has participated in four alliance tournaments,
fought in countless conflicts all over the EVE universe,
held space, built an outpost, taught thousands and thousands of players about PVP,
and countless other accomplishments.
You can learn more about the history of Agony in our <a href="https://wiki.agony-unleashed.com/The_History_of_AGONY">Agony Empire History</a> article.</p>

<h2>The Agony Philosophy</h2>

<ul>

  <li>PVP is fun: enjoy it and don't be a jerk.</li>

  <li>PvP is a challenge: pay attention and fly smart.</li>

  <li>Honour your word: you stand to gain more by keeping it than you do by breaking it.</li>

  <li>There are no enemies, only opponents.</li>

  <li>If you're going to do something, do it well.</li>

  <li>Knowledge should be shared, not hoarded: smarter opponents will force you to up your game.</li>

  <li>SP and ISK don't make you a better PVPer: they make you a better target.</li>

  <li>Winning through superior tactics is more satisfying than winning through superior numbers.</li>

</ul>

<h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2>

<h3>Where is Agony&#39;s HQ?</h3>

<p>Agony currently bases out of E-YJ8G in Catch.</p>

<h3>Who is the CEO of Agony?</h3>

<p>Gizznitt Malikite.</p>

<h3>What does Agony do?</h3>

<p>We PVP, plain and simple.</p>

<p>We operate nearly exclusively in nullsec, avoid blues, shoot anything that moves,
and generally try to be pretty damn good at what we do.
We expect our members to always be improving.
We favor tactics and intelligence over numbers and brute force.</p>

<h3>How can my corporation apply to join the Agony Empire alliance?</h3>

<p>Agony is a one corporation alliance.
If you&#39;re interested in merging into Agony, please contact Gizznitt.</p>

<h3>What is Agony&#39;s position on blues?</h3>

<p>We don&#39;t maintain permanent blues.</p>

<p>From time to time, we&#39;ll consider setting positive standings with a small number of people
in order to accomplish a particular objective
We don&#39;t set defensive blues.</p>

<h3>If you guys live in nullsec and don&#39;t have a ton of blues, how do you ever make ISK?</h3>

<p>Agony pilots are mostly independent, and responsible for making ISK on their own.
Some have trade alts, mission alts, or POS network and industry alts in empire.
Others go ratting or missioning in nullsec.</p>

<h3>Is Agony like EVE University? Do I join in order to take classes?</h3>

<p>While Agony and EVE-Uni both teach new players,
there are a few fundamental differences.</p>

<p>First and foremost, Agony as a corporation is distinct from our PvP University.
Agony Unleashed operates as a nullsec PVP corporation day to day,
and only runs classes now and then as a service to the EVE community.
Students do not join Agony in order to take classes,
and not everyone in Agony runs classes.
In addition Agony does not focus solely on teaching new students,
but on teaching and learning PVP in general.
We develop and teach advanced tactics as well as basic ones.</p>

<p>While EVE University provides a broad introduction to the game,
Agony seeks to provide a deep understanding of just PVP.</p>

<h3>Isn&#39;t Agony just a new player PVP training corporation?</h3>

<p>No.
Agony is a small gang nullsec PVP corporation.</p>

<p>We offer PvP University and our classes as a service to the EVE community
to promote the game that we love.
EVE PVP is a unique game experience, but it can be formidable as an outsider.
We seek to help ease this transition, and to prepare new players to fight back.</p>

<h3>Are you pirates?</h3>

<p>No.
As per our rules of engagement, we only shoot those in lowsec
who have demonstrated that they are willing to PVP in lowsec.</p>

<p>We operate in nullsec and consider lowsec an uninteresting distraction.
In nullsec on the other hand, we will shoot at anyone
who is not in Agony (or in an Agony gang), or one of our allies.
If you&#39;re in nullsec, you choose to be there and accept that you will be shot at.</p>

<h3>Do you accept contracts from other corporations or alliances? Are you mercenaries for hire?</h3>

<p>We have accepted mercenary contracts in the past,
but it&#39;s a rare occurrence.
If you&#39;re interested, contact Gizznitt.</p>

<h3>Do you hold space or intend to?</h3>

<p>Agony does not artificially limit what we do.</p>

<p>While Agony has held Sov in the past,
the current sovereignty mechanics and landscape doesn&#39;t mesh well
with a small-gang PVP Alliance that doesn&#39;t want permanent blues.</p>

<p>We do not currently hold space, nor do we plan to in the near future.</p>

<h3>Can anyone join Agony? Is it by invite only? By skill points?</h3>
