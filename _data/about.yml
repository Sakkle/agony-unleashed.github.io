philosophy:
  - "PVP is fun: enjoy it and don’t be a jerk."
  - "PvP is a challenge: pay attention and fly smart."
  - "Honour your word: you stand to gain more by keeping it than you do by breaking it."
  - "There are no enemies, only opponents."
  - "If you’re going to do something, aim to do it well."
  - "Knowledge should be shared, not hoarded: smarter opponents will force you to up your game."
  - "SP and ISK don’t make you a better PVPer, they make you a better target."
  - "Winning through superior tactics is more satisfying than winning through superior numbers."
